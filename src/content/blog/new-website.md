description: A more content-oriented and minimalistic website.
---

Hi, if you are reading this, you are are on my new website. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Although from a design perspective, my old website might have been better, I am not very good at design and turning that design into reality with CSS. Like many websites I’ve built before, I was initially satisfied with the design, I eventually got tired of it. Especially after some layout randomly broke, I felt like I didn’t want to deal with the design complexities my old website faced.

What pushed me to make this change was seeing my friend’s websites that were mainly text/markdown based. I liked the minimalism those websites had and the raw substance they possessed, and how it spared me from most of the burden of designing a website. At first, I didn’t know what framework to use to build this site. Luckily, my friend Zoya suggested that I use [Astro](https://astro.build/), and after downloading a template that I liked, I instantly fell in love. In a few hours, I had a mostly-complete personal website. 

You might notice that some of my old blog posts have been moved over. Those are blog posts I didn’t particularly like so I simply didn’t transfer them over to the new site. 

As always, the source code of this website is available on [Github](https://github.com/alx-alexpark/parkalex.dev-ng). Also, the old website is still up at [old.parkalex.dev](https://old.parkalex.dev). 

Anyways, i’ll try to post more on this blog in the coming months.
